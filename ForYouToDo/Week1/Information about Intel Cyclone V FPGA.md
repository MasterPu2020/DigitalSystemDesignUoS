# INFORMATION ABOUT CYCLONE V  
***
## Logic elements contained in Cyclone V  
### Up to 300,000.
The CycloneÂ® V FPGA core architecture comprises the following:  
- Up to 300K equivalent logic elements (LEs) arranged as vertical columns of adaptive logic modules (ALMs).  
- Up to 12 Mb of embedded memory arranged as 10 Kb (M10K) blocks.  
- Up to 1.7 Mb of distributed memory logic array blocks (MLABs).  
- Up to 342 variable-precision digital signal processing (DSP) blocks that can implement up to 684 18x18 embedded multipliers.  
- Eight fractional clock synthesis phase-locked loops (PLLs).

## Similarity between Xilinx FPGA and Intel Cyclone V  
### Take the Xilinx ZYNQ 7000 SoC as an example, it has up to 6.6M logic cells and offered with transceivers ranging from 6.25Gb/s to 12.5Gb/s which is more powerful and can be applied to more professional areas. But similar to the Intel Cyclone V, Xilinx ZYNQ 7000 SoC also integrates the software programmability of an ARM-based processor with the hardware programmability of an FPGA.
