# Digital System Design *ELEC6236*  
***  
## Recent Update!  
### Week 2: For you to do on **Friday**.  
### INFOR: I recently infected COVID, so I apologize that the update speed may slow down.
## Announcement  
I'm one of the MSD students in 2022 learning this course.  
And I build this repository for uploading some 'For you to do' coursework that might not be counted into marks.  
Also for sharing some information about System Verilog that might be useful.  
All the works in this repository are done by Clark myself.

## Tools  
1. EDA Tools (Free)  
    - [Vitis](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-platform.html) (Pre Vivado, note that Vitis is not suitable for Intel FPGA! Maybe you DON'T want to download it!):   
    - [Quartus](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/736572/intel-quartus-prime-lite-edition-design-software-version-21-1-1-for-windows.html?) Prime Lite   
    - Modelsim now is unavailable, although it is really useful. 
    - [Questa](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/746695/questa-intel-fpgas-edition-software-version-22-3.html ) Intel FPGA version (Mentor now is a memeber of Siemens, and Modelsim now is renamed as Questa. I don't know if this link works but I'll still stick it here)   
2. IDE Tools (Free)  
    - [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (For code version management)  
    - GitHub: That's where you are now.  
    - Notepad (Windows original): On any Windows machine, helpful to deal with the hand-writing-coding exam!  
3. Languages  
    - System verilog  
    - Verilog  
    - VHDL  
## About VS code  
### Recommended:  
- Verilog_Testbench: Automaticly generate testbench but **depend on python 3**  
- Verilog-HDL/SystemVerilog/Bluespec SystemVerilog: Mark with colours and support a co-complier!  
## Information  
For Chinese learners who have not learned Verilog before, you can find some really helpful information on this [website](https://www.runoob.com/w3cnote/verilog-data-type.html).
