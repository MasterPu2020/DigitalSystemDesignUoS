# Digital System Design *ELEC6236*  
***  
## Announcement  
I'm one of the MSD students in 2022 learning this course.  
And I build this repository for uploading some 'For you to do' coursework that might not be counted into marks.  
Also for sharing some information about System Verilog that might be useful.  
All the works in this repository are done by Clark myself.
